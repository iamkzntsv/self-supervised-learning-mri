# Self-Supervised Learning MRI

Welcome to the `self-supervised-learning-mri` repository! This project explores the use of latent variable models for self-supervised anomaly detection on brain MRI data. By leveraging self-supervised learning techniques, it aims to contribute to the development of cutting-edge anomaly detection methods without the need for labeled data.

## Dependencies

To use this project, you will need to have the MONAI Generative Models library installed. You can find it at the following link:
